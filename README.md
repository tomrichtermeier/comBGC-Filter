<img src="images/com-bgc-logo.png" alt="Werner Siemens Foundation" width="250" />

comBGC is a command-line tool designed to combine, filter, and merge the results from three major BGC prediction tools: deepBGC, GECCO, and antiSMASH. It ensures that only high-quality, non-redundant BGCs are included in the final output.

ðŸ”¹ Parses results from multiple BGC prediction tools into a unified table  
ðŸ”¹ Filters BGCs based on quality metrics and removes redundancies  
ðŸ”¹ Merges overlapping BGCs on the same contig, keeping the largest one  
ðŸ”¹ Provides a structured and easy-to-interpret final output
